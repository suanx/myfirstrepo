Hello, this is Sujan. I have just created a repository named "myfirstrepo".

While creating it, I unticked the option to include a README.mdfile.

Now, I need to follow some commands to connect the remote repository to the local repository. After that, I will practice the following commands:

git push

git pull

git fetch

git stash

git stash pop

For branch management, I will practice:

Creating a branch

Creating and switching branches

Deleting a branch

Additionally, I will practice:

git rebase

Creating custom conflicts and resolving them.
